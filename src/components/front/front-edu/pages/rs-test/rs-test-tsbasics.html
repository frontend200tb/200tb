1. Which of the following are correct ways to perform type assertions in TypeScript?

const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;

const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");

const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as string;

const myCanvas = (HTMLCanvasElement)document.getElementById("main_canvas");
2. What distinguishes type aliases from interfaces in TypeScript?

Type aliases are extendable, while interfaces are not.

Type aliases cannot be re-opened to add new properties, while interfaces can.

Type aliases are more powerful and versatile than interfaces.

Interfaces cannot be used to declare the shapes of objects.
3. In TypeScript, which syntax is used to declare a variable that can be either a 'number' or a 'string'?

Types cannot be combined in TS.

number && string

number | string

number || string

number & string
4. With strictNullChecks turned on in TypeScript, what is the behavior when a value is null or undefined?

Values can be accessed normally without any issues

Null and undefined can be assigned to a property of any type.

Values must be tested for null or undefined before using methods or properties.

Both a and b.
5. In TypeScript, what is the default visibility modifier for class members?

public

private

protected

internal
6. What does the function type expression (a: string) => void mean in TypeScript?

A function with one parameter named "a" of type string, returning void.

A function with one parameter named "string" of type any.

A function with a parameter named "a" of type any.

A function with no parameters and returns void.
7. According to Microsoft recommendations, should the name of an interface in TS start with an additional 'I'?

Yes, it should.

No, it is not recommended.
8. Select types in TS:

int

string

object

any

boolean

tuple

never

double

Array
9. When working with class constructors in TypeScript, what is a key difference between function signatures and constructor signatures?

Constructors can have type parameters, unlike functions

Constructors can have return type annotations, unlike functions

Constructors always return the class instance type

Constructors cannot have default values for parameters
10. How do you correctly describe the type of a function: function func(){ console.log("My function"); };

()=>string;

()=>void;

(string)=>void;

(undefined)=>void;

There is no correct answer.
11. What does the keyof operator do?

It takes an array and produces a union of its elements.

It takes an object type and produces a union of its keys.

It converts a string or number into a union type.

It extracts the values from an array of objects.
12. What is the purpose of intersection types in TypeScript?

To create new types by extending existing types using the & operator.

To define the relationship between interfaces and objects.

To handle conflicts between types and aliases.

To create generic helper types.
13. What is the value of C in enum One {A = 1,B = 5,C,D = 0}?

3

undefined

6

5

There will be an error
14. Can JavaScript code be executed in a file with the .ts extension?

Yes, it can.

No, it cannot.
15. Is the function call func('1','2') valid for the function function func(a: number, b: number){ ...some code... }?

The call is valid, there will be no error.

The call is incorrect, but there will be no error.

The call is incorrect and there will be an error.
16. Valid syntax in TS:

let test = "hello world";

let test: string = "hello world";

let test string = "hello world";

let string test = "hello world";

let test: any = "hello world";
17. What is a limitation of const assertions?

They can only be applied to complex literal expressions.

Const contexts immediately convert expressions to be fully immutable.

They cannot be used with array literals.

They can only be applied to simple literal expressions.
18. Can you set a value that is another expression (e.g., a function call) as the default value for function parameters in TS?

No, you cannot.

Yes, you can.

By default, you cannot, but you can create conditions under which it becomes possible.
19. How can you add type annotations to variables in TypeScript?

Before the variable, using "int x = 0;" style declarations.

After the variable, using "let x: string = 'hello';" style declarations.

Using the type keyword.

TypeScript automatically infers types; no annotations needed.
20. Does array destructuring work in TS?

Yes

No, it doesn't work

Only in readonly arrays
21. Is it possible to combine two or more other types to form a combined type representing values that may be any one of those initial types?

Yes, it is called a union.

Yes, it is called an onion.

Yes, it is called a merger.

No, it is not possible.
22. In the expression 'let test: string = "hello world"; test = 23;'

No error will occur.

There will be an error because the type is not specified in the second expression.

There will be an error because the types of the first and second expressions do not match.

There is no correct answer.
23. Can a function in TS accept another function as an argument?

Yes, it can.

No, it cannot.

By default, it cannot, but you can create conditions under which it becomes possible.
24. Which TypeScript strictness flag makes TypeScript issue an error on variables implicitly inferred as 'any'?

strictNullChecks

noImplicitAny

strict

noSurpriseVariables

noAnyChecks
25. What does the postfix ! operator do in TypeScript?

It negates a boolean value.

It asserts that a value isn't null or undefined.

It converts a variable to a different type.

It is used for arithmetic operations.
26. Can you pass more parameters than expected in a function call in TS?

No, you cannot.

Yes, you can.
27. Which type corresponds to the array let arr = [1, 2, 3];?

number[ ]

string[ ]

Array

Array<number>

Array<string>
28. Which type corresponds to the array let arr = [1, 2, 3]; where the elements cannot be modified?

ReadonlyArray<number>

ReadonlyArray<string>

ReadonlyArray

readonly string[ ]

readonly number[ ]
29. When deciding between type aliases and interfaces, what is recommended to use?

Always use type aliases for better performance.

Use type for simple structures and interfaces for complex structures.

Use interfaces until you need features from type, then switch to type.

There is no significant difference; choose based on personal preference.
30. Select the type for let person = ["Alan", 20];

It is impossible to write a type for this structure

number[ ]

[number, string]

string[ ]

[string, number]

[never]

[any]
31. What values can the type-checking operator return?

symbol

number

boolean

tuple

string

undefined

bigint

any
32. Can a function in TS return an object?

Yes, it can.

No, it cannot.

By default, it cannot, but you can create conditions under which it becomes possible.

It depends on the type of function (declaration, expression, arrow).
33. Can you use alert() in TS?

Yes, you can.

No, you cannot.
